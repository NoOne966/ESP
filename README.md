# ESP - Employee Salary Prediction

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict employee salary classes based on various input features such as:

- Age  
- Education  
- Occupation  
- Hours per week  
- Years of experience  

## 📁 Structure

- `pro.ipynb`: Main notebook for building and predicting salary class (upload from Google Colab)
- `model/`: Folder containing serialized model files (`.pkl`) for deployment
- `data/`: (To be added) for raw or cleaned CSV datasets

## 🚀 Features

- Uses Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost
- Streamlit-based UI for prediction
- SMOTE for balancing imbalanced data
- Deployment-ready structure (for Render or other platforms)

## 📌 TODO

- [ ] Add cleaned dataset
- [ ] Add API / Web interface
- [ ] Deploy on Render or Hugging Face Spaces
